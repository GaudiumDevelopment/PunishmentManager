# How to contribute
## How to write a pull request

-Be polite and relaxed

-Take criticism as trying to learn from your mistakes not as that someone is trying to bully you

-Write a contructive summary about what you did and why it should be added

## Formatting of commits and PRs
(everything in the parentheses "<>" should be replaced

-Things added should be formatted like this: -added <thing> because of <feature request number>

-Things that are fixed should be formatted like this: -fixed <insert issue number if it exists> <short summary about what went wrong>

-Things that are removed should be formatted like this: -removed <thing> <reason>

-Things that are changed should be formatted like this: -changed <thing> <from> -> <to> <reason>

## How to make a new feature
Make a fork! Do not use your organization to fork it but your personal account, this way we can edit things more easily! If you are completely done, you can make a PR and we will look in to it as soon as possible! make sure you branch of the master branch!

## What branch serves what purpose?

release: Everything is as stable as it can be.

release_candidate: pretty stable, made for people who want new features fast but don't care if there are one or two bugs in it.

master: This is the coding hellhole, everything here is only for testing. Bugs are everywhere and things are waiting to be transferred to the dev branch. tl;dr: This branch is unstable as hell and only used for developing new features.
