# How to contribute
## How to write a pull request

-Be polite and relaxed

-Take criticism as trying to learn from your mistakes not as that someone is trying to bully you

-Write a contructive summary about what you did and why it should be added

## Formatting
(everything in the parentheses "<>" should be replaced

-Things added should be formatted like this: -added <thing> because of <feature request number>

-Things that are fixed should be formatted like this: -fixed <insert issue number if it exists> <short summary about what went wrong>

-Things that are removed should be formatted like this: -removed <thing> <reason>

-Things that are changed should be formatted like this: -changed <thing> <from> -> <to> <reason>
