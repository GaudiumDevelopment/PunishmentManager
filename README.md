# PunishmentManager
A punishment plugin for all your punishment needs! Punish those bad players with a fancy gui!

PunishmentManager tries its best to provide maximal customisablity. Want to calculate how hard a player should be punished? It's possible! Want to set certain thresholds for certain punishments? It's possible!

**This is my first public spigot plugin coded with java, I am still a beginner so don't start talking to me in some super advanced java language.**
