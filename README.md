# PunishmentManager
A punishment plugin for all your punishment needs! Punish those bad players with a fancy gui!

PunishmentManager tries its best to provide maximal customisablity. Want to calculate how hard a player should be punished? It's possible! Want to set certain thresholds for certain punishments? It's possible!

Want some indev builds to try out? Click [ ![Download](null/packages/moderationmanager/PunishmentManager/INDEV/images/download.svg?version=INDEV_build_30) ](https://bintray.com/moderationmanager/PunishmentManager/INDEV/INDEV_build_30/link) to get them! (indev â‰  dev builds, I wont take care of backwards compatability, things can change really fast, and bugs will almost be certainly present.)

# WARNING: STILL WORK IN PROGRESS! 
## Indev versions are likely to not be backwards compatible with each other.
# NEVER USE INDEV VERSION ON A PRODUCTION SERVER, IT IS POSSIBLE YOU WILL HAVE TO RESET YOUR WHOLE DATABASE BECAUSE OF DATABASE CHANGES!!!
